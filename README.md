KYCSecure
=========

Decentralized Identity Verification and KYC Contract
----------------------------------------------------

KYCSecure is a Clarity smart contract designed to provide a robust and decentralized system for identity verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance on the Stacks blockchain. It empowers users to register their identities, submit necessary verification documents, and allows authorized third-party verifiers to approve various levels of KYC compliance (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced). The contract prioritizes privacy and security while offering a transparent and auditable verification process.

### ‚ú® Features

-   **Identity Registration:** Users can register their unique identities on the blockchain.

-   **Multi-Level KYC:** Supports different levels of KYC verification (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) based on the depth of compliance required.

-   **Authorized Verifiers:** A system for the contract owner to authorize specific entities to perform KYC verification, along with their maximum allowed verification level.

-   **Pending Verification Requests:** Manages and tracks user-submitted KYC requests awaiting approval from authorized verifiers.

-   **Privacy-Preserving Document Handling:** Stores only a cryptographic hash of the verification documents, ensuring user document privacy while allowing for integrity checks.

-   **Expiration Mechanism:** KYC verifications have an expiration date, requiring periodic re-verification.

-   **KYC Analytics & Batch Operations:** Provides advanced functionality for compliance monitoring, allowing authorized entities to perform batch operations and retrieve detailed analytics on user KYC statuses.

-   **Contract Pause Mechanism:** An emergency control to temporarily pause contract operations.

### üöÄ Deployment

To deploy this contract, you will need the Stacks CLI or a compatible wallet.

1.  **Save the contract:** Save the Clarity code into a file, e.g., `kyc-secure.clar`.

2.  **Deploy using Stacks CLI:**

    ```
    clarity-cli tx deploy kyc-secure.clar <YOUR_STX_ADDRESS>

    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_STX_ADDRESS>` with the address you want to deploy from. This address will become the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

### üí° Usage Examples

Here are some conceptual examples of how to interact with the `KYCSecure` contract using typical Clarity interaction patterns. Replace `<contract-address>` with the actual address where the contract is deployed.

Assume the contract is deployed at `SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure`.

```
;; 1. Authorize a Verifier (by CONTRACT-OWNER)
;; Let 'ST1A...BCD' be the address of the verifier.
(as-contract tx-sender (contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' authorize-verifier 'ST1A...BCD' u3))
;; Expected: (ok true)

;; 2. Register an Identity (by a User)
;; Let 'ST2E...FGH' be the address of the user.
;; document-hash example (replace with actual document hash)
(as-contract tx-sender (contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' register-identity 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef))
;; Expected: (ok true)

;; 3. Submit a KYC Request (by the User 'ST2E...FGH')
(as-contract tx-sender (contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' submit-kyc-request u2 0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890123456 'Intermediate KYC Request'))
;; Expected: (ok u1) (assuming this is the first request, request-id u1)

;; 4. Get Pending Request Details (Read-only)
(contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' get-pending-request 'ST2E...FGH' u1)
;; Expected: (some { ... request details ... })

;; 5. Approve KYC Verification (by the Verifier 'ST1A...BCD')
(as-contract tx-sender (contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' approve-kyc-verification 'ST2E...FGH' u1))
;; Expected: (ok true)

;; 6. Get Identity Information (Read-only)
(contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' get-identity 'ST2E...FGH')
;; Expected: (some { ... identity details including kyc-level: u2 ... })

;; 7. Check if User has Valid KYC (Read-only)
(contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' has-valid-kyc 'ST2E...FGH' u1)
;; Expected: true

(contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' has-valid-kyc 'ST2E...FGH' u3)
;; Expected: false (since they are only Intermediate)

;; 8. Perform Batch KYC Analytics (by CONTRACT-OWNER or Authorized Verifier)
;; Assuming 'ST2E...FGH' and 'ST3I...JKL' are registered users
(as-contract tx-sender (contract-call? 'SP123...XYZ.kyc-secure' batch-kyc-analytics-and-operations (list 'ST2E...FGH' 'ST3I...JKL') "COMPLIANCE_CHECK" u1 true))
;; Expected: (ok { detailed-results: (list { ... ST2E...FGH analytics ... }, { ... ST3I...JKL analytics ... }), ... summary ... })

### üîí Security Considerations

While this contract provides a framework for decentralized identity and KYC, it's crucial to understand the following:

-   **Document Storage:** The contract only stores a hash of the documents. The actual documents are managed off-chain, and their storage and security are outside the scope of this smart contract.

-   **Verifier Trust:** The integrity of the KYC process heavily relies on the trustworthiness and diligence of the authorized verifiers. The contract provides the mechanism, but the due diligence of verifiers is paramount.

-   **Hash Collisions:** While unlikely, cryptographic hash collisions are theoretically possible. Using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA256 as implied by `buff 32`) minimizes this risk.

-   **Block Height Dependence:** Expiration is tied to `block-height`. Fluctuations in block production times could slightly affect exact timeframes.

-   **`CONTRACT-OWNER` Security:** The `CONTRACT-OWNER` has significant power (e.g., authorizing verifiers, pausing the contract). Securing the `CONTRACT-OWNER`'s private key is critical.

Always perform thorough audits and testing before deploying smart contracts to a production environment.
